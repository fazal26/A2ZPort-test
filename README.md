# A2ZPort-test

This task is a pure JS based function, which returns the maximum length word in a sentence.
Given a string it looks for the max lengthy word and if it comes accross two words with same max length, it returns the word having most vowels in it.

The code includes a check for certain special characters, but more can be added to the collection.

Demo:

- simply pass a long string to the function
- it will return the max word in that sentence
